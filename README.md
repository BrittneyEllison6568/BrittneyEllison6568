## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I build and share full-stack CRUD applications using Vite, React, and Prisma. This space is focused on creating clean, scalable, and responsive web apps that manage data efficiently while providing a solid foundation for real-world use cases.

As a full-stack developer, I enjoy working across the stackâ€”from designing user-friendly interfaces in React to managing data models and queries with Prisma. With Vite as the build tool, Iâ€™m able to streamline development with fast hot module replacement and minimal setup, making the workflow smoother and more efficient.

The projects in this repository are centered around core CRUD functionality: creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a way thatâ€™s intuitive for users and maintainable for developers. Whether itâ€™s a simple task manager, a blog platform, or a user dashboard, each app demonstrates a full stack setup, including API routes, database schemas, UI components, and basic validation.

Using Prisma as the ORM, I focus on defining clear, type-safe data models and connecting them to a lightweight backend. On the frontend, I use React with component-based architecture and often integrate tools like React Router, Zustand, or form libraries for better state and input handling.

This repository includes well-organized code, setup instructions, and notes explaining architecture decisions, challenges, and areas for improvement. Itâ€™s a growing collection of practical examples aimed at both learning and sharing development patterns.

If youâ€™re building CRUD apps or interested in how Vite, React, and Prisma work together in a modern full-stack environment, I hope you find these projects helpful. Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration are always welcome as I continue to refine my stack and build better, faster web applications.
